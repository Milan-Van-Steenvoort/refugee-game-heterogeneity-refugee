      <ul>
      <li> You are assigned the role of <strong>refugee</strong>.
      <li> In the following decision task, you will be asked to state how much you believe participants from group A and participants from group B will give to you in different situations.
      <li> You can earn between 0 and 25 points in decision task 2. One of your estimates will be randomly selected for payment. The payoff you will receive will depend on the accuracy of your estimate, with respect to the average decisions taken by participants who were assigned the role of citizens in another experiment, in the given situation. If your estimate is five or more units away from the actual value, your payoff in decision task 2 will be 0. If your estimate is less than five units away from the actual value, then the closer your estimate gets to the actual value the higher your payoff will be. Therefore, it is in your best interest to report your actual belief in each situation. 
      <li> Before we ask you for your estimates, you will have to answer several comprehension questions about this experiment. There are six questions in total. If you answer wrongly more than five times, you will be excluded from participating in this study. Note that in case you answer wronfully to a question, an error message will be displayed beneath that question. Click "Next" to begin the test questions.
