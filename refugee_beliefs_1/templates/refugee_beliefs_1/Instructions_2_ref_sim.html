   <p><u><h3>There are two types of players in the decision game</h3></u></p>
   <div> <font size="4"> 
      <ul>
      <li><b>Citizens</b>
      <ul>
      <li>Citizens are participants who take part in a typing task where they have to fill in 5 sequences of numbers and letters and earn <strong> 25 or 75 points</strong>. All participants that are assigned the role of citizen perform the exact same task.
     <li>40% of the points that are earned in the typing task are withheld and collected in a common account. You can think of these as taxes that citizens have to pay.
     </li>
     <ul><li> 40% of 75 points: <strong> 30 points </strong> </li></ul>
     <ul><li> 40% of 25 points: <strong> 10 points </strong> </li></ul>
      <li>The remaining 60% are a citizen's personal earnings.
     </li>
     <ul><li> 60% of 75 points: <strong> 45 points </strong>  </li></ul> 
     <ul><li> 60% of 25 points: <strong> 15 points </strong>  </li></ul> 
      </ul>
      <li><b>Refugee</b>
      <ul>
      <li>The refugee does not participate in the typing task and therefore cannot contribute to the common account.
     </li>
      <li>The refugee has no own income.
      </ul>
      </p>
   </div>

   <p><u><h3>Each game consists of one refugee and two groups of four host citizens.</h3></u></p>
      </ul> 
      <li> There are two groups of citizens: group A and group B.
      <li>Each group consists of 4 citizens.
      <li>After finishing the typing task, all citizens within a group earn the same amount of points, but earnings can differ between groups.
      </ul>
